## Statement of Contribution

Udaya Shanker Mohanan Nair () was mainly responsible to do Question 2. Dhanush Kumar Reddy Narayana Reddy (dhana004) was mainly responsible to do Question 1. The group report was compiled through discussion in a google document by everyone and the final draft was made using rmd.

## Question 1: Sampling triangular distribution

The function  f(x)  is defined as:

$$
f(x) =\begin{cases} 0, & \text{if } x < -1 \text{ or } x > 1, \\
x + 1, & \text{if } -1 \leq x \leq 0, \\1 - x, & \text{if } 0 < x \leq 1.
\end{cases}
$$

### Part D

####Comparision:

Rejection Sampling Time:

user  system elapsed

0.00    0.00    0.11


Composition Sampling Time:

user  system elapsed

0.00    0.00    0.02


Difference of Uniforms Time:

user  system elapsed

0       0       0

####Choosing the Best Method:

Rejection Sampling is slower compared to the other methods because it involves an accept-reject step. Many proposed samples are discarded, leading to inefficiencies and a longer execution time. However, it is a flexible method that can be applied to more complex distributions where direct sampling is difficult.

Composition Sampling is efficient and provides accurate results since it relies on the inverse cumulative distribution function. However, it requires prior knowledge of the inverse CDF, which may not always be easy to derive for complex distributions. Once the inverse CDF is known, the method is straightforward and computationally efficient.

Difference of Uniforms is the simplest and fastest method since it only requires generating two independent uniform random numbers and taking their difference. It has minimal computational overhead and does not require any accept-reject steps or knowledge of the inverse CDF, making it the preferred choice for efficiency.

The difference of uniforms method is the most efficient and easiest to implement. Based on execution time and simplicity, the difference of uniforms method is the preferred choice for generating samples of X.

Variance for Difference uniform sampling is 0.1682124.
